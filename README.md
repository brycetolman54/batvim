# NeoVim Setup

- This is the neovim setup that I am using.
- What to know:
    - I am not using a plugin manager.
    - All of my plugins (I will not use many) are stored in the `pack/plugins/start` directory
    - The `plug-lock.json` file shows all of the plugins that I am using
        - It shows the `user/repo` so you can clone them after you clone this repo
    - I may add a script to clone them for you in the future
